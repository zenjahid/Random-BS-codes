Excellent question! This gets to the heart of time series forecasting methodology.

## What This Approach Is Called

This methodology is called **Online Learning** or **Incremental Learning** with **Walk-Forward Validation**. Specifically, it's a form of:

1. **Expanding Window Walk-Forward Validation** - The training window grows each iteration
2. **Online Model Updating** - The model learns from its errors and incorporates new data
3. **Recursive Retraining** - The model is retrained at each step with new information

## How Practical Is This Implementation?

### **Theoretical Ideal (What your faculty described):**
```python
# Perfect world scenario
model = initial_model()
for month in range(1, 13):
    train_data = data[up_to_previous_month]
    model.train(train_data)           # Train on all available data
    predictions = model.predict(next_month)
    actuals = get_actuals(next_month)
    errors = calculate_errors(predictions, actuals)
    model.learn_from_errors(errors)   # Magic learning from errors
    save_results(predictions, actuals)
```

### **Practical Reality (What actually works):**
```python
# Real-world implementation
models = []  # Store each month's model
predictions_list = []

for month in range(1, 13):
    train_data = data[up_to_previous_month]
    
    # Train NEW model on expanded data (not update existing one)
    current_model = RandomForest()  # Fresh model each time
    current_model.fit(train_data)
    
    predictions = current_model.predict(next_month)
    actuals = get_actuals(next_month)
    
    models.append(current_model)      # Store this month's model
    predictions_list.append(predictions)
    
    # Analysis happens separately - model doesn't "learn from errors" automatically
    analyze_errors(predictions, actuals)
```

## Why True "Learning from Errors" is Challenging:

### **1. Technical Limitations:**
- Most ML models (especially Random Forest, XGBoost) don't have built-in "learn from errors" capability
- They're batch learners - you retrain from scratch, they don't incrementally update
- True online learning models are specialized (like Online SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent)

### **2. Practical Implementation:**
What we actually do is:
- **Retrain completely** each month with more data
- **Analyze errors** to understand model weaknesses
- **Manually adjust** features or parameters based on error analysis
- **The model improves** because it sees more data, not because it magically learns from mistakes

### **3. Realistic Approach:**
```python
# What we actually implement in the code
all_metrics = []

for i in range(1, num_months):
    # 1. Train on all data up to previous month
    train_data = data[:previous_month_end]
    model = train_model(train_data)
    
    # 2. Predict next month
    test_data = data[next_month_start:next_month_end]
    predictions = model.predict(test_data)
    
    # 3. Compare with actuals
    actuals = test_data['Close']
    metrics = calculate_metrics(predictions, actuals)
    all_metrics.append(metrics)
    
    # 4. "Learning" happens here - we analyze and potentially adjust for next month
    if metrics['error'] > threshold:
        print(f"High error in month {i},可能需要调整特征或参数")
    
    # 5. Move to next month (model doesn't carry over, we retrain fresh)
```

## Practicality Assessment:

### **✅ Advantages:**
1. **Realistic Validation**: Simulates how you'd use the model in production
2. **No Data Leakage**: Strictly avoids using future information
3. **Performance Tracking**: Shows how model performance evolves over time
4. **Adaptability**: Can detect changing market conditions

### **⚠️ Challenges:**
1. **Computationally Expensive**: Retraining models from scratch each month
2. **No True "Error Learning"**: Models don't automatically learn from mistakes
3. **Storage Intensive**: Need to keep each month's model and results
4. **Complex Implementation**: More complicated than simple train-test split

### **🔄 What Actually Improves:**
The model gets better because:
- **More training data** each month
- **We manually analyze** errors and adjust features/parameters
- **We identify patterns** in when the model fails
- **Not because** the model has some magical error-learning capability

## Conclusion:

Your faculty is describing the **ideal theoretical approach**, but in practice, we implement a **practical approximation**:

**Theoretical:** "Model learns from its errors automatically"  
**Practical:** "We retrain with more data and manually analyze errors to improve the system"

The implementation I provided is the **industry-standard practical approach** that achieves the same goal: rigorous month-by-month validation with expanding data, followed by comprehensive error analysis and model improvement.

This is exactly what hedge funds and trading firms do for model validation - it's extremely practical and represents best practices in financial forecasting.
