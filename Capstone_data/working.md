Here's a concise abstract explanation of the stock prediction system:

**Abstract Overview**

This is a comprehensive stock price prediction system that combines statistical time series models (ARIMA) with machine learning (LightGBM) to forecast stock prices. The system processes historical stock data, handles missing values through intelligent interpolation, and evaluates multiple modeling approaches.

**Key Components & Workflow:**

1. **Data Processing:**
   - Cleans data by handling missing values (using median/mode imputation)
   - Detects and fixes gaps in time series data through:
     * Business-day frequency alignment
     * Time-based interpolation for numeric values
     * Forward-filling for categorical data
   - Creates technical indicators (moving averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI, etc.)

2. **Modeling Approaches:**
   - **ARIMA:** Traditional time series model for baseline predictions
   - **ARIMAX:** ARIMA extended with exogenous variables (technical indicators)
   - **ARIMA+LGB Hybrid:**
     * ARIMA captures time series patterns
     * LightGBM corrects residuals using technical/fundamental features
     * Combined prediction = ARIMA forecast + ML correction

3. **Key Features:**
   - Automated model selection (auto-ARIMA)
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Comprehensive evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
   - Overfitting/underfitting detection
   - Backtesting with time-series cross-validation
   - Visualization of results

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Uses pandas for data manipulation
   - statsmodels for ARIMA/SARIMAX
   - LightGBM for machine learning component
   - pmdarima for automated ARIMA parameter selection
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Innovative Aspects:**
1. **Smart Interpolation:** Uses time-aware interpolation for stock prices while maintaining business-day frequency
2. **Hybrid Modeling:** Combines strengths of statistical and ML approaches
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creates both basic and derived technical indicators
4. **Robust Evaluation:** Includes backtesting and learning curve analysis

**Outputs:**
- Prediction visualizations (actual vs predicted)
- Model performance metrics
- Saved models for future use
- Comprehensive CSV reports

The system is designed to handle both simple historical price data and enriched datasets with fundamental indicators, automatically adapting its approach based on data availability. The hybrid ARIMA+LightGBM approach typically shows the best performance by leveraging both temporal patterns and feature relationships.
